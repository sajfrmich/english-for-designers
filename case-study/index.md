# CASE STUDY - REBRAND
# Creation of a new logo and communication for the transport company Litv√≠nov and Most

## 1. Research
We found out what the logos of transport companies in other cities look like and how they communicate.

## 2. Sketches
Then we started sketching and discussing the first designs of our logo.

## 3. New and old logo
In the new logo we worked with the up and down arrows that you can see in the old logo.

The letter "d" and "p" are also indicated in the logo.

We used the yellow colour from the old logo and instead of red we chose a grey colour to mark the roads.

We have created variations of the logo according to the means of transport, the colours chosen for each means of transport are still written on the map.

## 4. Communications
We have created a map of the transport companies from which their communication is based.

On posters, traffic cards, the web and other you can see cut-outs of the routes of transport 
companies.
