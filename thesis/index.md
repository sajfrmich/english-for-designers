## Abstract

This bachelor thesis is a real project that will be implemented. The bachelor thesis deals with the issue of the lack of visual and marketing communication of the agricultural company Botep and subsequently the promotion of the field itself.
The theoretical part defines the corporate identity and its connection with the corporate image, culture, communication and design, which deals with the different graphic elements. Subsequently, marketing mix concepts such as public relations, advertising, and especially online communication are defined. The practical part is firstly an analytical part and then the overall visual identity. 
The practical part is complemented by mockups that show the development of the graphic visual. 

**Keywords: Logo, visual identity, marketing communication, graphic design, agriculture**


## Botep is prosperous agricultural company.

A family company that deals with vegetable production and its export to both **Czech and German mills**.
Botep operates in **three regions**. 
The company had no corporate identity until now, and now it wants to change that. This will mainly involve the creation of a logo and subsequent corporate communication mainly through online media. Through research I found that it is surrounded by several **agricultural secondary schools**.

**The target** group is mainly students and graduates of agricultural schools, i.e. young people between the ages of 16 and 26.  This is a target group with an interest in the agricultural sector and BOTEP itself.

The **logo** itself is based on the name of the company BOTEP
The designed logo uses the Galano Grotesque sans-serif font, which is complemented by a symbol in front of the name itself, this symbol is meant to represent the wasps from the ear itself, the landscape from a bird's eye view.


## Visual identity
The main output of the visual identity is based on the principle of a **bird's eye view of the landscape**. 
These **natural elements** also give a **sketched, geometric impression**.
This landscape layout is separated in the visual by a **white line**. 
The landscape layout can be filled in with **colour, pattern or photography**. 
The visual style is also complemented by **symbols** that are intended to be geometrically reminiscent of the **agricultural theme**.

The **main idea** of the whole concept is to make the BOTEP brand and the **agricultural sector as a whole more attractive**.

**Online communication** is chosen as the main communication element with regard to the target group
Primarily it will be social networking platforms such as **Instagram, Facebook and Tiktok**
