Hi, I'm  Michaela

I consider myself a creative person, I enjoy creating.
I don't care if it's purely graphic design, illustration, painting, drawing, linocut, trying new painting techniques or baking custom cakes. 
This is what I am all about. 
As long as I can create something with my hands, I'm happy.
